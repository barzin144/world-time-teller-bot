# World time teller telegram bot
>This is a telegram bot 😁  
You can add your favorite cities that you like to know what time is there 😁  

## Commands
First, send /time command to the bot then start to config the bot, and also you can add this bot into the groups then config that there.
- /time
- /add_to_config
- /reset_config

## Development
If you want to develop this bot or run it on your local machine you need to first create a firebase database and add serviceAccountkey.json into the project (which has the configuration of the firebase)

## Development commands
- npm install
- npm run local-start

I used "localtunnel" for setting a valid URL as a telegram bot webhook, this library is forwarding the telegram request into your local host
